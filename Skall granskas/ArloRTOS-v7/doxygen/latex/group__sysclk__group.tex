See sysclk\-\_\-quickstart.

The {\itshape sysclk} A\-P\-I covers the {\itshape system clock} and all clocks derived from it. The system clock is a chip-\/internal clock on which all {\itshape synchronous clocks}, i.\-e. C\-P\-U and bus/peripheral clocks, are based. The system clock is typically generated from one of a variety of sources, which may include crystal and R\-C oscillators as well as P\-L\-Ls. The clocks derived from the system clock are sometimes also known as {\itshape synchronous clocks}, since they always run synchronously with respect to each other, as opposed to {\itshape generic clocks} which may run from different oscillators or P\-L\-Ls.

Most applications should simply call sysclk\-\_\-init() to initialize everything related to the system clock and its source (oscillator, P\-L\-L or D\-F\-L\-L), and leave it at that. More advanced applications, and platform-\/specific drivers, may require additional services from the clock system, some of which may be platform-\/specific.\hypertarget{group__sysclk__group_sysclk_group_platform}{}\subsection{Platform Dependencies}\label{group__sysclk__group_sysclk_group_platform}
The sysclk A\-P\-I is partially chip-\/ or platform-\/specific. While all platforms provide mostly the same functionality, there are some variations around how different bus types and clock tree structures are handled.

The following functions are available on all platforms with the same parameters and functionality. These functions may be called freely by portable applications, drivers and services\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item sysclk\-\_\-init()
\item sysclk\-\_\-set\-\_\-source()
\item sysclk\-\_\-get\-\_\-main\-\_\-hz()
\item sysclk\-\_\-get\-\_\-cpu\-\_\-hz()
\item sysclk\-\_\-get\-\_\-peripheral\-\_\-bus\-\_\-hz()
\end{DoxyItemize}

The following functions are available on all platforms, but there may be variations in the function signature (i.\-e. parameters) and behavior. These functions are typically called by platform-\/specific parts of drivers, and applications that aren't intended to be portable\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item sysclk\-\_\-enable\-\_\-peripheral\-\_\-clock()
\item sysclk\-\_\-disable\-\_\-peripheral\-\_\-clock()
\item sysclk\-\_\-enable\-\_\-module()
\item sysclk\-\_\-disable\-\_\-module()
\item sysclk\-\_\-module\-\_\-is\-\_\-enabled()
\item sysclk\-\_\-set\-\_\-prescalers()
\end{DoxyItemize}

All other functions should be considered platform-\/specific. Enabling/disabling clocks to specific peripherals as well as determining the speed of these clocks should be done by calling functions provided by the driver for that peripheral.
